Decrement the TTL by 1, and recompute the packet checksum over the modified header.
Find out which entry in the routing table has the longest prefix match with the destination IP address.
Check the ARP cache for the next-hop MAC address corresponding to the next-hop IP. 
If it’s there, send it. Otherwise, send an ARP request for the next-hop IP 
(if one hasn’t been sent within the last second), and add the packet to the queue of packets waiting on this ARP request.

1. Check Sum check
2. header length check
3. TTL check
4. Find the the correct itnerface 
    if the interface is this router (do something with it)
        if the packet is an icmp packet
            send the correct ICMP mesage
        if the packet is a tcp or udp protocol foward it   
            forward packet

1.decrement tll
2. conduct longest prefix matching 
3. If a prefix is found 
    check the arp cache `sr_arpcache_lookup
    if no entry in arp cache
    add matched address to the arp cache `sr_arpcache_queuereq`
3. if no prefix is found
   send ICMP net unreachable
